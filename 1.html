<p>Filipino desired for independence led to numerous uprisings. The most important of these began in 1896 and continued until the United States defeated Spain in 1898 in the Spanish-American War. </p>
<p>Independence was declared at that time, but the terms of the treaty of Paris in 1898 ceded the Islands to the United States. The War of Resistance from 1899 to 1902 against U.S. rule is now referred to by many Filipinos as the Philippine-American War.</p>
