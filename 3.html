<p>Japan launched an attack on the Philippines on 1941, just ten hours after their attack on Pearl Harbor. Initial aerial bombardment was followed by landings of ground troops both north and south of Manila.

 The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. He had been recalled to active duty in the United States Army earlier in the year . 

Douglas was designated commander of the United States Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region. The aircraft of his command were destroyed, the naval forces were ordered to leave. And  this because of the circumstances in the Pacific region, reinforcement and resupply of his ground forces were impossible.

The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in 1942. Corregidor , Quezon and Osmeña had accompanied the troops to Corregidor and later left for the United States, where they set up a government-in-exile. MacArthur was ordered to Australia, where he started to plan for a return to the Philippines.

Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at Bataan. They were forced to undertake the infamous “Bataan Death March” to a prison camp 105 kilometers to the north.</p>
