<p>On August 21, 1971, while the opposition (Liberal Party) was having their mitting de advance in Plaza Miranda, two fragmentation grenades exploded. It took 9 lives and left more than 100 people seriously wounded.

Some Liberal Party candidates were seriously injured. Including Jovito Salonga, who nearly died and was visually impaired. Suspicion of responsibility for the blast initially fell upon Marcos, whom the Liberals blamed for the bombing.

Based on interviews of The Washington Post with former Communist Party of the Philippines Officials. It was revealed that “the (Communist) party leadership planned  and three operatives carried out the attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution…

 (Communist Party Leader) Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the former party officials said. Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had already agreed to provide.</p>
