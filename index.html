<p>The Philippines, consist of more than 7,000 separate islands in the western Pacific. It was declared independence from Spanish rule over 120 years ago. Gen. The Philippine Islands were discovered by Magellen in 1521, and claimed by Spain. The first successful settlements were made in 1565. </p>
<p>The original peoples were largely Malay and Indonesian tribes, Negritos The earliest inhabitants were Negritos, sometimes called Pygmies and mainly Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>The influence of Muslim traders and teachers was felt in the Philippines as early as the 11th century. By the 14th century many Filipinos in the southern areas had been converted to Islam. They were called Moros by the Spanish. The Spanish were not able to fully contain the Moros until the latter half of the 19th century. In the early period the colony was quite isolated from Spain, which led to near autonomy by the colonial leaders. </p>
<p>The population was converted to Roman Catholicism, and a strong centralized government with considerable clerical influence developed. Filipino groups Tagalog, Visayan, Bikol, Ilokano, Igorot, Ifugao, Tinggian, Bukidnon, Bagobo, still maintained their identity and languages, but Spanish was introduced throughout the country.</p>
<p>Trade restrictions were eased in the 19th century creating a wave of prosperity. Chinese immigration increased dramatically during this period as did Spanish emigration from the newly independent countries of Latin America.</p>
